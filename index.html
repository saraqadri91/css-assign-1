        <p class="p1"> i saw the sign
        </p>
        <p class="heee">and it opened up my eyes. One of my favorite things to do is to capturethe american nostalgia of
            signage. They tell us where we’re going or where we’ve been. They express a mood or saying can even
            just be a shape. But it’s
            the vintage, neon, and big light bulbed signs that say so much more. They aren’t just your average square
            shapes
            with letters on it. Some actual thought and planning went into the making of the sign. Oh and the lost
            are of
            advertising with nneon signsthat display motion is always a fun find! Such a lost art in my opinion.
            LED just
            hurts my eyes...doesn’t it?</p>
